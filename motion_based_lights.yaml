  description: >
    Turn a light on and off based on detected motion but only if certain criteria a matched provided by a Illuminance-Sensor or a Guest Mode input_boolean.  
    Also allows to disable motion aware lights. This might be useful for example if a person is in the bed or a movie is playing.
